#Usage:
Save the script to a file (e.g., extract_public_subnets.py). Then, you can run it from the command line like this:
python extract_public_subnets.py input_file.txt output_file.txt

Replace input_file.txt with the path to your input file containing IP subnets, and output_file.txt will contain the extracted public IP subnets.
